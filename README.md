# Kubeflow Pipelines Backend for Tekton

Kubeflow Pipelines backend for Tekton. This project is a follow-on to [KFP-Tekton Compiler project](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfp-tekton), and will allow to take the compiled Tekton yaml to Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) engine and run it through KFP API and UI using the SDK

This project is in very early development phase. Instructions will be laid out as we make more progress with implementation.
